# [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/rotate-array/)


Given an array, rotate the array to the right by _k_ steps, where _k_ is non-negative.

**Follow up:**

*   Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
*   Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
*   `0 <= k <= 10<sup>5</sup>`



## Solution

- Approach 1: Helper array

```go
func rotate(nums []int, k int) {
	n := len(nums)
	k %= n

	B := append(nums[n-k:], nums[:n-k]...)

    copy(nums, B)   // copy(dst, src)
}
```

- Approach 2: Reverse three times

```go
func rotate(nums []int, k int) {
    n := len(nums)
    k %= n
    
    reverse(nums, 0, n-k-1)
    reverse(nums, n-k, n-1)
    reverse(nums, 0 ,n-1)
}

func reverse(A []int, i, j int) {
    for i < j {
        A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]
        i++; j--
    }
}
```
