## [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/)


Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.



## Solution

```go
func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
    n := 0
    for _, v := range nums {
        if n < 2 || v != nums[n-1] || nums[n-1] != nums[n-2] {
            nums[n] = v
            n++
        }
    }
    return n
}
```
