# [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/)


Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates such that duplicates appeared at most _twice_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by **modifying the input array** with O(1) extra memory.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `nums` is sorted in ascending order.



## Solution

```go
func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
    n := 0
    for _, v := range nums {
        if n<2 || v!=nums[n-1] || nums[n-1]!=nums[n-2] {
            nums[n] = v
            n++
        }
    }
    return n
}
```
