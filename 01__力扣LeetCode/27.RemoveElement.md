# 27. Remove Element

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example 1:

```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

# Solution

```java
    // Two Pointers: a[0..j-1] always contains numbers with `val` removed
    // Every time we find a value a[i] different from `val`, append it to a[j] and increment j to j+1
    // return: j because a[0..j-1] contains j elements
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int j = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (nums[i]!=val) {
                nums[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
```
